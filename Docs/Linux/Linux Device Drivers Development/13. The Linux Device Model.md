1. LDM data structures
- The bus

    A bus is a channel link between devices and processors.The hardware entity that manages
    the bus and exports its protocol to devices is called the bus controller
    A bus is represented in the kernel by the struct bus_type structure: :
    struct bus_type {
        const char *name;
        const char *dev_name;
        struct device *dev_root;
        struct device_attribute *dev_attrs; /* use dev_groups instead */
        const struct attribute_group **bus_groups;
        const struct attribute_group **dev_groups;
        const struct attribute_group **drv_groups;
        int (*match)(struct device *dev, struct device_driver *drv);
        int (*probe)(struct device *dev);
        int (*remove)(struct device *dev);
        void (*shutdown)(struct device *dev);
        int (*suspend)(struct device *dev, pm_message_t state);
        int (*resume)(struct device *dev);
        const struct dev_pm_ops *pm;
        struct subsys_private *p;
        struct lock_class_key lock_key;
    };
    The following are the meanings of elements in the structure:
    - match : This is a callback, called whenever a new device or driver is added to the bus
    - probe : This is a callback when a new device or driver is added to the bus, after the match has occurred
    - remove : This is called when a device is removed from the bus
    - suspend : This is a method called when a device on the bus needs to be put into sleep mode
    - resume :This is called when a device on the bus has to be brought out of sleep mode
    - pm :
    - drv_groups :
    - dev_groups :
    - bus_group :
    Bus registration
- The device driver
    A global device hierarchy allows each device in the system to be represented in a common way.
    struct device_driver {
        const char *name;
        struct bus_type *bus;
        struct module *owner;
        const struct of_device_id *of_match_table;
        const struct acpi_device_id *acpi_match_table;
        int (*probe) (struct device *dev);
        int (*remove) (struct device *dev);
        void (*shutdown) (struct device *dev);
        int (*suspend) (struct device *dev, pm_message_t state);
        int (*resume) (struct device *dev);
        const struct attribute_group **groups;
        const struct dev_pm_ops *pm;
    };
    - name :
    - bus :
    - module :
    - of_match_table :
    - suspend and resume :
    - probe :
    - group :
    Device driver registration
- The device
    The struct device is the generic data structure used to describe and characterize each
    device on the system.
    struct device {
        struct device *parent;
        struct kobject kobj;
        const struct device_type *type;
        struct bus_type *bus;
        struct device_driver *driver;
        void *platform_data;
        void *driver_data;
        struct device_node *of_node;
        struct class *class;
        const struct attribute_group **groups;
        void (*release)(struct device *dev);
    };
    - parent :
    - bus :
    - type :
    - kobj :
    - of_node :
    - platform_data :
    - driver_data :
    - class :
    - group :
    - release :
    Device registration
2. Deep inside LDM
- kobject structure
    kobject is the core of the device model
    struct kobject {
        const char *name;
        struct list_head entry;
        struct kobject *parent;
        struct kset *kset;
        struct kobj_type *ktype;
        struct sysfs_dirent *sd;
        struct kref kref;
        /* Fields out of our interest have been removed */
    };
    - name :
    - parent :
    - sd :
    - kref :
    - ktype :
- kobj_type
    A struct kobj_type structure describes the behavior of kobjects

    struct kobj_type {
        void (*release)(struct kobject *);
        const struct sysfs_ops sysfs_ops;
        struct attribute **default_attrs;
    };
- ksets
    Kernel object sets (ksets) mainly group related kernel objects together
    struct kset {
        struct list_head list;
        spinlock_t list_lock;
        struct kobject kobj;
    };
    - list :
    - list_lock :
    - kobj :
- Attributes
    Attributes are sysfs files exported to the user space by kobjects
    struct attribute {
        char * name;
        struct module *owner;
        umode_t mode;
    };
    The kernel functions used to add/remove attributes from the filesystem are as follows :
    int sysfs_create_file(struct kobject * kobj, const struct attribute * attr);
    void sysfs_remove_file(struct kobject * kobj, const struct attribute * attr);
3. The device model and sysfs
- Sysfs files and attributes
- Allowing sysfs attribute files to be pollable
